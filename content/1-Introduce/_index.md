**AWS Storage Gateway** is a service that helps connect on-premises environments to the AWS cloud easily and securely. This allows you to extend or migrate file storage to AWS without disrupting current operations.

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Set up a File Gateway to synchronize file data to Amazon S3.
- Mount a file share on an on-premises server or EC2 instance for direct data access.
- Utilize Amazon EFS as a flexible, scalable file storage solution in AWS.
- Monitor the system through Amazon CloudWatch to ensure stable operations.

Benefits of using Storage Gateway and EFS:

- Maintain your existing workflows while extending storage capabilities to the cloud.
- Enhance security and centralized management with AWS IAM and CloudWatch.
- Reduce costs and improve data management efficiency.

Through this workshop, you will gain practical knowledge to deploy a modern, efficient, and secure file storage solution on the AWS platform.
